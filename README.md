## WARNING: The script is encoded with a United States Keyboard layout! If you are not using a USA layout, you need to encode the .txt file I provided on your own!

### For educational purposes only! I am not responsible for anything you do!
**Chrome Artemis** is a script built for the Ruber Ducky that collects saved passwords from a machine and emails them to your Gmail address!

What **Chrome Artemis** does:

  - Disable Windows Defender
  - Downloads the required programs
  - Saves passwords to a .txt file
  - Email the .txt file to your Gmail account

You can also:
  - Modify the script so it sends the .txt to a server via FTP.
  - Anything you really want


## Installation

You don't need Twin Duck! All files are downloaded from the web. Just drop the **inject.bin** file on your rubber ducky and you're ready to go!


## Usage

Just plug in the Rubber Ducky and wait. After the script runs, it'll lock the user's screen and delete the downloaded files.
- Change **#GMAIL#** to your Gmail account
- Change **#PASSWORD#** to your Gmail password!


# WARNING
This version will not make you "invisible" to the system admin. It doesn't delete all the downladed files and leaves basic traces. If you'd like to get the safe version contact me on Instagram: @nejc03
