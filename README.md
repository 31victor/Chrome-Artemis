## WARNING: The script is encoded with a United States Keyboard layout! If you are not using a USA layout, you need to encode the .txt file I provided on your own!

### For educational purposes only! I am not responsible for anything you do!
**Chrome Artemis** is a script built for the Ruber Ducky that collects saved passwords from a machine and emails them to your Gmail address!

What **Chrome Artemis** does:

  - Disable Windows Defender
  - Downloads the required programs
  - Saves passwords to a .txt file
  - Email the .txt file to your Gmail account

You can also:
  - Modify the script so it sends the .txt to a server via FTP.
  - Anything you really want


## Installation

You don't need Twin uck! All files are downloaded from the web. Just drop the **inject.bin** file on your rubber ducky and you're ready to go!


## Usage

Just plug in the Rubber Ducky and wait. After the script runs, it'll lock the user's screen and delete the downloaded files.
- Change **#GMAIL#** to your Gmail account
- Change **#PASSWORD#** to your Gmail password!
